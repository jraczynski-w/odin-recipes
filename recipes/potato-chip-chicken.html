    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Potato Chip Chicken is crispy on the outside, tender on the inside,
         and packed with flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. chicken tenders, or boneless, skinless chicken</li>
        <li>1 pint buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large bag plain, wavy potato chips</li>
        <li>Ranch flavor Packet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum
             foil and spray liberally with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>If you're using boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 
            cut them into strips or nugget-sized pieces. 
            Pour the buttermilk into a large bowl, and let the chicken soak
             for 10 minutes, or up to 30 minutes--however much time you have!</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to crunch the potato chips while they're in the bag,
             then pour them into a pie plate. Add ranch packet One-by-one, take the
              chicken from its buttermilk bath, roll it in the potato chips,
              then set them on the prepared cookie sheet.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until chicken is done and the potato
             chips are golden brown. The baking time will depend on the
              size of your chicken--if you did smaller pieces or strips,
               so watch carefully</li>
        <li>Serve with ranch dip (ranch dressing packet mixed with sour cream),
             honey mustard, and ketchup.</li>                     
    </ol>
